    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Jin Lee. \n
        I like watching dramas, read novels, and play games. \n
        These days I usually play Genshin Impact which is made by Mihoyo. \n
        I actually play for all day, so I try to play GenShin less than 3 hours a day. \n
        Yesterday I had a coding test in my house with my computer, and I found out that my friends were actually having the test too.
        if you do not already have the AboutMe app from a previous codelab, download the starter code, AboutMeInteractive-Starter. This the same code you finished in a previous codelab.
        Open the AboutMeInteractive-Starter project in Android Studio. \n
        Run the app. You see a name text view, a star image, and a long segment of text in a scroll view. \n</string>
